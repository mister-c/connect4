What you have left to do

You need to find out how to cut out shapes from other shapes
DONE
Is this the same thing as a mask?
NO

You have created a way for the game chip to fall from the top of the screen
DONE
You have a way to use phaser's integrated rendering to create a sprite from a rendering of a red circle
DONE

You have a data structure to represent the grid of chips
DONE


For now...
Have the animation of the falling chips occur
DONE
Use collisions so the chips land in roughly the correct location on the grid when they are placed
DONE


To improve....
Have the animation of the falling chips occur
DONE
Have a boolean that represents if the object is or is not being animated
DONE

Once the object stops moving then force its coordinates to the correct location on the grid
Not done yet
If the animation takes too long, it should time out and the coordinates should be forced to the correct location on the grid
